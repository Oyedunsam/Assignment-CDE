# Assignment-CDE
My assignment for Git
Wrote few Git scripts to do some specific task like Extract, Transform and Load (ETL)

#Extract

I extracted a csv file from a website and created a folder raw in which I saved the file I extracted 

#Transform
I wrote codes to change a column from the csv file
Changed the column from Variable_code to variable_code
I created a new csv file from the one extracted by picking out 4 columns (year, Value, Units, variable_code). 
I save the content of these selected columns into a file named 2023_year_finance.csv
And saved it in a folder called Transformed 

#Load
I created a new folder called Gold

I load the data into the new folder called Gold from Transformed.
